# Project Overview
**The data set used in this project is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting**

This project has been created to analyse and visualise a set of sales data to gain insights and assist a company to make informed business decisions. The aim of the project was to get a comprehensive understanding of sales performance and sales/product trends.

The project includes the following features:

- Data Exploration: The data is explored and analysed through Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to identify sale trends, sales performance and top performing products
- Data Visualisation: The insights found from the exploration and analysis are then visualised through dashboards created in both Excel and Power BI

The three product categories in this data are:

Technology: *Accessories, Copiers, Machines, Phones*

Furniture: *Bookcases, Chairs, Furnishings, Tables*

Sale Performance: The total sales for all products increased from $479,856 in 2015 to $722,052 in 2018 which indicates a positive trend in sale performance. 

Product Category Performance: Among the three product categories, the technology category consistently generated the highest sales, followed by furnitures and office supplies. However, it can be said that all three categories showed overall growth in sales over the four-year period.

Yearly Sales Trend: The sales for each product category fluctuated year-to-year, with some years showing higher growth than others. For instance, in 2017, all three product categories experienced a significant leap in sales compared to the previous years.

As mentioned, Technology is the highest sales-generated category with total sales of $827,456, followed by Furniture with total sales of $728,659 and Office Supplies with total sales of $705,422. Within the Technology category, Phones and Accessories are significant contributers for sales performance with sales of $327,782 and $164,187 respectively. This indicates a strong demand for both which mean they should be prioritised in sale strategies.

Office Supplies can still be seen as a substantial contributer to overall sales generated but there will be a need for further market analysis of the low performing sub-categories: Labels at $12,348, Paper at $76,828 and Fasteners at $3002. 

**Market Analysis** - There has been a decline in demand for traditional office supplies such as paperwork as this is being transferred to digital platforms.

In the Furniture category, the sub-categories have vary sales performance between them. Chairs and Tables have generated the highest sales compared to Furnishings and Bookcases.

Technology category: The sales of Technology category decreased by 7% in 2016 but had a major increase by 37% in 2017 and 21% in 2018. This indicates a decline in sales in 2016 which was  followed by strong sales growth in 2017 and moderate sales growth in 2018.

Office Supplies category: The sales of Office Supplies category decreased by 11% in 2016 but like the Technology category sales increased by 37% in 2017 and 32% in 2018. This indicates a significant comeback in sales in 2017 which is followed by a sustained sales growth of 32% in 2018.

**Technology**

- California has the highest total sales in the Technology category, with $154,684. This indicates that California is a significant market for Technology products, as there is a high demand for these products.
- New York comes in second with total sales of $126,903 which suggests there is a significant market for technology products which is then followed by Texas with total sales of $64,656.
- The Grand Total sales for the Technology product category is $604,043. The total sales for the top three states in this category is $346,243. California, New York and Texas contribute for more than 50% of sales in the top 10 states for the product category.
- Few factors could be bought up to give an explanation for these figures:
- California, New York and Texas are the most populated states in the US which would mean a higher customer population meaning a higher demand for tech products
- Urban areas in California (Silicon Valley) and New York are known for having a high concentration of tech development, companies and tech startups. This would inevitably create an environment where there is more favor towards tech products which results in higher sales.

**Office Supplies**

- Same for the Technology category, California, New York and Texas are the states with the highest sales produced. Again this comes down to the fact all three states have a large population meaning large markets and large demand. This would result in higher sale volumes for office supplies
- New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco are cities known for having a large concentration of business hubs, corporate offices and headquarted corporations which would result in needing steady supply of office supplied products.

**Furniture**

- As with the other two categories, California, New York and Texas are the major contributers for sales in the Furniture category.
