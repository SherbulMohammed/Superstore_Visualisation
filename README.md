# Project Overview
**The data set used in this project is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting**

This project has been created to analyse and visualise a set of sales data to gain insights and assist a company to make informed business decisions. The aim of the project was to get a comprehensive understanding of sales performance and sales/product trends.

The project includes the following features:

- Data Exploration: The data is explored and analysed through Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to identify sale trends, sales performance and top performing products
- Data Visualisation: The insights found from the exploration and analysis are then visualised through dashboards created in both Excel and Power BI

Technology: *Accessories, Copiers, Machines, Phones*

Furniture: *Bookcases, Chairs, Furnishings, Tables*

Office Supplies: *Appliances, Art, Binders, Envelopes, Fasteners, Labels, Paper, Storage, Supplies*

Sale Performance: The total sales for all products increased from $479,856 in 2015 to $722,052 in 2018 which indicates a positive trend in sale performance. 

Product Category Performance: Among the three product categories, the technology category consistently generated the highest sales, followed by furnitures and office supplies. However, it can be said that all three categories showed overall growth in sales over the four-year period.

Yearly Sales Trend: The sales for each product category fluctuated year-to-year, with some years showing higher growth than others. For instance, in 2017, all three product categories experienced a significant leap in sales compared to the previous years.
