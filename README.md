# Project Overview
**The data set used in this project is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting**

This project has been created to analyse and visualise a set of sales data to gain insights and assist a company to make informed business decisions. The aim of the project was to get a comprehensive understanding of sales performance and sales/product trends.

The project includes the following features:

- Data Exploration: The data is explored and analysed through Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to identify sale trends, sales performance and top performing products
- Data Visualisation: The insights found from the exploration and analysis are then visualised through dashboards created in both Excel and Power BI

Sale Performance: The total sales for all products increased from $479,856 in 2015 to $722,052 in 2018 which indicates a positive trend in sale performance. 

Product Category Performance: Among the three product categories, the technology category consistently generated the highest sales, followed by furnitures and office supplies. However, it can be said that all three categories showed overall growth in sales over the four-year period.

Yearly Sales Trend: The sales for each product category fluctuated year-to-year, with some years showing higher growth than others. For instance, in 2017, all three product categories experienced a significant leap in sales compared to the previous years.

As mentioned, Technology is the highest sales-generated category with total sales of $827,456, followed by Furniture with total sales of $728,659 and Office Supplies with total sales of $705,422. Within the Technology category, Phones and Accessories are significant contributers for sales performance with sales of $327,782 and $164,187 respectively. This indicates a strong demand for both which mean they should be prioritised in sale strategies.

Office Supplies can still be seen as a substantial contributer to overall sales generated but there will be a need for further market analysis of the low performing sub-categories: Labels at $12,348, Paper at $76,828 and Fasteners at $3002. 

**Market Analysis** - There has been a decline in demand for traditional office supplies such as paperwork as this is being transferred to digital platforms.

In the Furniture category, the sub-categories have vary sales performance between them. Chairs and Tables have generated the highest sales compared to Furnishings and Bookcases.
